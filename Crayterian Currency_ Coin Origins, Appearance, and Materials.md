# Crayterian Currency: Coin Origins, Appearance, and Materials

## Gold Cidoki

**Origin:** The cidoki originated in Kharadum during the Age of Shapers' Tears when master metallurgists discovered a method to infuse gold with trace amounts of starlight essence from Aethelgard. The name "cidoki" derives from the ancient Kharadum term meaning "metal of covenant," as these coins were first minted to seal a historic trade alliance between Kharadum's craft guilds and Aethelgard's noble houses.

**Appearance:** Larger than other gold coins, the cidoki is perfectly circular with a thickness of 3mm and a diameter of 28mm. The obverse features the profile of the current Oracle surrounded by seventeen stars, representing the seventeen sacred metals of Kharadum tradition. The reverse displays the Great Forge Mountain with intricate detailing that includes tiny veins of actual silver running through the mountain design. The edge is inscribed with microscopic runes that glow faintly blue when exposed to strong starlight, a security feature nearly impossible to counterfeit.

**Material:** Composed of 95% pure gold with a proprietary alloy that includes traces of starlight-infused silver from Aethelgard and minute amounts of volcanic glass from Pyros. This unique composition gives the coin a distinctive weight and a subtle golden-white luster that seems to capture and hold light.

**Cultural Significance:** Possessing even a single cidoki is considered a mark of significant wealth or importance. In Kharadum, gifting a cidoki to a master craftsman is the highest form of praise for their work. In Aethelgard, cidoki are often incorporated into ceremonial regalia of the highest nobility. Many citizens of Crayteria will never handle a cidoki in their lifetime.

## Gold Ab

**Origin:** The ab emerged from Serenissima's floating cities, where wind merchants needed a currency valuable enough for major transactions but more practical than the cidoki. The name comes from "abrilla," meaning "wind-carried" in ancient Serenissiman, referring to how these coins were originally transported between floating islands by specialized wind couriers.

**Appearance:** Slightly smaller than the cidoki at 24mm in diameter and 2mm thick, the ab has a distinctive hexagonal shape with smoothed edges. The obverse features a stylized wind pattern surrounding a central aperture—a small hole that allows the coin to make a specific whistling sound when thrown or dropped, another anti-counterfeiting measure. The reverse bears the image of Aria, Serenissima's principal floating city, with such fine detail that a magnifying glass reveals tiny windows and spires.

**Material:** Composed of 90% gold with an alloy that includes copper and small amounts of lightweight metals unique to Serenissima. This composition gives the coin a warmer golden hue than the cidoki and makes it slightly lighter than pure gold would be at that size.

**Cultural Significance:** In Serenissima, the hole in each ab is often threaded with colored silk threads to denote specific commercial agreements or debts. In Solara, abs are traditionally given as wedding gifts, with the number eighteen (matching the exchange rate to cotedo) considered particularly auspicious. Merchants throughout Crayteria often wear a single ab on a chain as a symbol of their profession.

## Silver Cotedo

**Origin:** The cotedo originated in Valdoria's mountain kingdoms, where silver mines produced abundant ore. The name derives from "cote d'eau," meaning "water's edge" in Old Valdorian, referring to the coin's original use in controlling water rights among mountain communities.

**Appearance:** The cotedo is square with rounded corners, measuring 22mm across and 1.5mm thick. The obverse features a mountain stream flowing into a stylized lake, with the water rendered in such fine detail that it appears to ripple when the coin is tilted. The reverse displays a different mountain peak for each year of minting, with 18 total mountains in the cycle (corresponding to its exchange rate with the ab). The edge is milled with a distinctive pattern of waves.

**Material:** Minted from 92% silver with additions of copper and trace minerals from Valdoria's mountains. This composition gives the coin exceptional durability and a slightly bluish-silver sheen that distinguishes it from other silver currencies.

**Cultural Significance:** In Valdoria and Xylos, cotedos are traditionally buried at the source of springs to ensure continued water flow—a practice that predates the Oracle's standardization. Many rural communities still measure wealth in terms of cotedos rather than higher-value coins. In urban centers, professional guilds often use cotedos exclusively for member dues and payments.

## Silver Macep

**Origin:** The macep emerged from Pyros' volcanic regions, where artisans developed techniques for extracting silver from volcanic deposits. The name comes from "macepra," meaning "fire-born" in ancient Pyrosian, reflecting both its origin and the coin's distinctive manufacturing process.

**Appearance:** Oval-shaped with a flat edge on one side, the macep measures 20mm at its longest point and is 1.2mm thick. The obverse features a stylized flame pattern that, due to special pigmentation in the silver, appears to flicker with red-orange hues when moved. The reverse bears the profile of a different Pyrosian Tyrant for each minting location, with the flat edge indicating the specific volcano where its silver was mined. The edge has irregular texturing that resembles cooling lava.

**Material:** Composed of 88% silver with copper, volcanic minerals, and trace amounts of rare elements found only in Pyros' lava flows. This composition gives the coin a distinctive weight and a slightly warmer tone than pure silver.

**Cultural Significance:** In Pyros and the Archipelagos of Whispers, maceps are often used in fire-reading divination, with the patterns of light reflecting off the coins interpreted as omens. Travelers traditionally carry maceps as protection against misfortune, particularly when journeying by sea. In many regions, the price of a good meal and a night's lodging is standardized at one macep.

## Bronze Deikous

**Origin:** The deikous is the oldest standardized currency in Crayteria, predating even the Oracle's unification efforts. Archaeological evidence suggests similar coins were used across multiple continents for thousands of years. The name derives from "deikos," a word common to several ancient languages meaning simply "piece" or "token."

**Appearance:** Perfectly round but with a scalloped edge of nine points (representing its exchange value with the macep), the deikous measures 18mm in diameter and is 1mm thick. The obverse features a simple sunburst design that has remained virtually unchanged for centuries. The reverse varies by region of minting, typically displaying local flora or fauna in stylized form. A small punch mark on the edge indicates the specific mint of origin.

**Material:** Cast in a bronze alloy that varies slightly by region but typically contains 85-90% copper with tin and small amounts of local metals. This variation gives deikous from different regions subtle differences in color, ranging from reddish to almost golden brown.

**Cultural Significance:** The deikous is the most commonly handled coin across all of Crayteria, used for everything from purchasing bread to tipping servants. Many folk traditions involve deikous: children are often given one on their naming day; travelers place them under stones at crossroads for luck; and in many regions, the dead are buried with a deikous under their tongue to pay for passage to the afterlife.

## Special and Regional Currencies

Beyond the five standard coins, several regions maintain special-purpose currencies that, while not part of the official Oracle-sanctioned system, are recognized for specific uses:

### Shifting Sands Time Tokens

Thin, glass-like discs made from sand exposed to temporal anomalies in the Shifting Sands. These tokens are not used for conventional trade but instead are exchanged for services requiring precise timing or temporal manipulation. They cannot be counterfeited as they literally contain captured moments of time, visible as swirling patterns that never repeat the same movement twice.

### Sylvandell Seed Coins

Compressed seed bundles encased in hardened tree resin, used exclusively within Sylvandell for transactions involving the forest's resources. These "coins" are valued not for their exchange rate but for the specific plants they can grow, with rarer seeds commanding higher value. They are accepted by the Oracle's tax collectors at standardized rates, though their actual worth fluctuates seasonally.

### Cryonian Ice Shards

Crystalline tokens containing permanently frozen water from sacred glaciers, used in Cryonia's tribal territories. These shards are valued by their clarity, size, and the specific glacier of origin. While primarily ceremonial, they are recognized by traders at northern outposts and can be exchanged for standard currency, typically at rates favorable to those accepting the shards.

## Minting and Control

The right to mint official Crayterian currency is tightly controlled by the Oracle, with authorized mints operating in each major continent under strict oversight. Counterfeit prevention is taken extremely seriously, with penalties ranging from hand amputation to execution depending on the region and scale of the offense.

Each authorized mint employs master craftspeople who train for decades to perfect their art. In Kharadum, becoming a cidoki-smith is considered one of the highest achievements possible, with only seventeen such positions existing at any time (again reflecting the seventeen sacred metals).

The Oracle maintains currency stability through a network of exchange houses that will convert any official coin to any other at exactly the official rate, minus a small transaction fee that funds the system's operation. This ensures that despite regional preferences and variations, the unified currency system facilitates trade throughout Crayteria.
