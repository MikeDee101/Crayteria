# Crayterian Currency: Exchange Rates and Practical Conversions

## Standard Exchange Rates

The official exchange rates between Crayterian currencies are:

- 1 gold cidoki = 15 gold ab
- 1 gold ab = 18 silver cotedo
- 3 silver cotedo = 16 silver macep
- 3 silver macep = 27 bronze deikous

## Complete Conversion Table

For ease of reference, here is a comprehensive conversion table showing the value of each coin in terms of all other denominations:

| Currency | Value in cidoki | Value in ab | Value in cotedo | Value in macep | Value in deikous |
|----------|----------------|------------|----------------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1 gold cidoki | 1 | 15 | 270 | 1,440 | 12,960 |
| 1 gold ab | 1/15 (0.067) | 1 | 18 | 96 | 864 |
| 1 silver cotedo | 1/270 (0.0037) | 1/18 (0.056) | 1 | 5⅓ | 48 |
| 1 silver macep | 1/1,440 (0.0007) | 1/96 (0.0104) | 3/16 (0.1875) | 1 | 9 |
| 1 bronze deikous | 1/12,960 (0.00008) | 1/864 (0.0012) | 1/48 (0.0208) | 1/9 (0.111) | 1 |

## Practical Conversion Examples

### Example 1: A Merchant's Calculation
A Kharadum merchant sells a masterwork sword for 2 gold cidoki. The buyer, a Serenissiman noble, wishes to pay in ab. The conversion would be:
- 2 cidoki × 15 ab/cidoki = 30 gold ab

### Example 2: Market Shopping
A traveler in Pyros has 2 silver cotedo and needs to purchase supplies at a local market where prices are listed in macep and deikous:
- 2 cotedo × (16 macep ÷ 3 cotedo) = 10⅔ macep
- In practice, this would be rounded to either 10 or 11 macep depending on local custom
- Alternatively, it could be expressed as 10 macep and 6 deikous (since 1 macep = 9 deikous)

### Example 3: Wage Calculation
A laborer in Valdoria earns 4 silver macep per day. Over a standard 6-day work week, their earnings would be:
- 4 macep × 6 days = 24 macep
- This could be converted to: 24 macep × (3 cotedo ÷ 16 macep) = 4½ cotedo
- Or to smaller units: 24 macep × (9 deikous ÷ 1 macep) = 216 deikous

### Example 4: Noble Expenditure
A noble from Aethelgard wishes to commission a grand feast costing 320 silver cotedo. To pay from their treasury of cidoki:
- 320 cotedo × (1 cidoki ÷ 270 cotedo) = 1.185 cidoki
- In practice, this would be paid as 1 cidoki, 2 ab, and 16 cotedo
- Calculation: 1 cidoki = 270 cotedo; 320 - 270 = 50 cotedo remaining
- 50 cotedo × (1 ab ÷ 18 cotedo) = 2.78 ab
- 2 ab = 36 cotedo; 50 - 36 = 14 cotedo remaining
- Final payment: 1 cidoki + 2 ab + 14 cotedo

## Regional Variations and Practical Considerations

### Fractional Values
The relationship between cotedo and macep (3 cotedo = 16 macep) creates fractional values that are handled differently across regions:

- In Kharadum and Aethelgard, precise calculations are valued, and merchants use small bronze weights to make up fractional differences
- In Pyros, values are typically rounded to the nearest whole coin, usually in favor of the more powerful party in the transaction
- In Serenissima, complex transactions often include "adjustment tokens" that represent fractional values, redeemable in future transactions
- In rural areas, fractional differences are often resolved through small additional goods or services rather than currency

### Regional Preferences
While all standard coins are accepted throughout Crayteria, regional preferences affect daily commerce:

- Valdoria and Xylos primarily use cotedo for most transactions, with macep and deikous for smaller purchases
- Pyros and the Archipelagos of Whispers favor macep, with many establishments refusing to make change for higher-value coins
- Serenissima and Solara commonly use ab for significant transactions, with cotedo for everyday commerce
- Kharadum and Aethelgard maintain separate treasuries of cidoki for international trade, while domestic commerce uses primarily ab and cotedo

## Exchange Houses and Banking

The Oracle maintains official Exchange Houses in every major city, where any coin can be converted to any other at exactly the official rate, minus a transaction fee of 1/100th of the total value. These institutions serve several purposes:

1. **Currency Stability** - By offering consistent exchange rates, they prevent regional fluctuations that could disrupt trade
2. **Coin Quality** - They regularly remove worn or clipped coins from circulation
3. **Wealth Storage** - For a fee, citizens can deposit coins for safekeeping and receive Exchange Notes redeemable at any Exchange House

Private money-changers also operate throughout Crayteria, offering convenience in exchange for less favorable rates. In border regions and trade hubs, specialized changers deal in foreign currencies as well as the standard Crayterian coins.

These prices vary by region and quality, but provide a general sense of relative value in the Crayterian economy.
