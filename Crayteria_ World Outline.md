# Crayteria: World Outline

## Core Concepts of Crayteria

*   **Overall Tone:** Epic fantasy with a strong emphasis on political intrigue, cultural clashes, and the long-term consequences of historical events. The world will have moments of grandeur and wonder, but also a gritty realism regarding power, conflict, and survival, akin to the ASOIAF inspiration.
*   **Magic System:** Magic in Crayteria is ancient and largely faded, often referred to as "The Echoes." Its remnants are found in specific bloodlines, forgotten artifacts, and places of power. True wielders of potent magic are exceptionally rare, often misunderstood or feared. The nature of magic is often tied to the natural world, elemental forces, or the spirits of ancestors. Some cultures revere its memory, while others actively suppress it.
*   **Historical Eras:** Crayteria's history is marked by several pivotal eras:
    *   **The Age of Titans:** A mythological period when colossal beings are said to have shaped the lands and skies. Their ruins and colossal skeletons dot the landscapes of many continents.
    *   **The Sundering:** A cataclysmic event, possibly magical or celestial in origin, that shattered a proto-continent into the current 14, leading to vast migrations, the loss of ancient knowledge, and the rise of distinct cultures in isolation.
    *   **The Age of Kingdoms:** The current era, characterized by the rise and fall of numerous kingdoms and empires across the continents, frequent wars, and the slow rediscovery of lost arts and histories.
*   **Overarching Conflicts/Themes:**
    *   The struggle for dwindling resources, particularly fertile land and rare minerals.
    *   The tension between ancient traditions and emerging new orders.
    *   The search for lost knowledge and the power it might unlock.
    *   The impact of deeply rooted cultural and religious differences leading to both alliances and devastating wars.
    *   The cyclical nature of history and power.
*   **Technological Level:** Generally pre-industrial, comparable to Earth's medieval period. Some isolated cultures might possess unique, localized advancements (e.g., advanced irrigation in a desert continent, unique shipbuilding techniques in an island nation), but widespread industrialization is non-existent. Metallurgy, agriculture, and warfare are key areas of development.
*   **Religious Diversity:** Multiple pantheons, ancestor worship cults, nature-based spiritualities, and organized religions with hierarchical structures exist across Crayteria. Religious differences are often a source of conflict or a defining cultural marker, much like the Old Gods vs. The Seven in ASOIAF.

## The Fourteen Continents of Crayteria

1.  **Aethelgard:** A vast, temperate continent dominated by feudal kingdoms and powerful knightly orders. Known for its fertile plains, dense forests, and a strong martial tradition. Remnants of Titan-era fortresses are common.
2.  **Xylos:** A continent almost entirely covered by a colossal, ancient jungle, teeming with exotic and dangerous flora and fauna. Its human inhabitants live in isolated city-states built within or atop giant trees, with cultures deeply connected to the jungle's spirit.
3.  **Solara:** A sun-scorched desert continent. Its people are predominantly nomadic tribes, masters of survival, and traders of rare desert goods. Ancient, sand-buried cities hint at a once-greener past and lost water-magic.
4.  **Cryonia:** A polar continent of ice sheets, towering glaciers, and perpetual twilight during its long winters. Inhabited by hardy folk who live in ice-hewn settlements and hunt colossal arctic beasts. Legends speak of slumbering powers beneath the ice.
5.  **Archipelagos of Whispers (The Whispering Isles):** A sprawling chain of thousands of volcanic islands, known for its skilled seafarers, diverse marine life, and volatile geology. Each major island group has a distinct culture, often clashing over trade routes and resources.
6.  **Valdoria:** A mountainous continent with towering peaks and deep, hidden valleys. Its inhabitants are reclusive, clan-based societies, renowned for their mining, metalwork, and resilience. Ancient ruins are carved into the mountainsides.
7.  **Serenissima:** A low-lying continent of marshes, intricate river systems, and floating cities. Its people are known for their diplomacy, intricate trade networks, and unique understanding of water and illusionary Echoes.
8.  **Pyros:** A volcanic and geothermally active continent, marked by obsidian plains, rivers of lava, and smoke-wreathed mountains. The cultures here have adapted to the harsh environment, some even worshipping the volcanic forces.
9.  **Sylvandell:** A continent of rolling hills, ancient woodlands, and mystical glades, said to be one of the last bastions of potent nature-based Echoes. Its inhabitants are often isolationist, protecting their sacred groves.
10. **Kharadum:** A vast, arid plateau continent, rich in mineral wealth but poor in water. Dominated by fortified city-states that constantly vie for control of mines and oases. Known for its ingenious engineers and siege weaponry.
11. **Aethelgard Minor (The Sundered Land):** A smaller continent, geographically and culturally linked to Aethelgard but separated during the Sundering. It possesses a more fragmented political landscape and often serves as a battleground for Aethelgard's larger powers.
12. **The Shifting Sands:** A continent where vast deserts are interspersed with pockets of surprisingly lush, magically sustained oases. Its cultures are diverse, ranging from powerful merchant republics in the oases to enigmatic desert mystics who harness the Echoes of the sands.
13. **The Sky-Reaches:** A continent defined by colossal, flat-topped mountains (mesas) that rise thousands of feet above the plains below. Civilizations have developed both on the plateaus and in the shadowed lands beneath, leading to unique cultural and technological divergences.
14. **Umbralia:** A continent perpetually shrouded in a thick, unnatural mist, its true geography and inhabitants largely a mystery to the outside world. Legends speak of strange creatures, forgotten peoples, and potent, dangerous Echoes within the mists.
