# Crayteria: Historical Epochs and Periods

This document outlines the major epochs and significant periods that define the historical sweep of Crayteria, drawing inspiration from the cosmological foundations and the diverse cultures of its fourteen continents. The timeline is measured in Cycles (equivalent to Earth years) from a conventionally agreed-upon point, often the founding of the Oracle or a similar continent-spanning event.

## I. The Dawn of Ages (Approx. -10,000 to -5,000 Cycles Oracle Reckoning - OR)

*   **The Age of Whispers (-10,000 to -8,000 OR):** Following the Genesis of Crayteria, this era is characterized by the raw, untamed power of the Echoes. Mortal races are nascent, scattered, and struggling for survival. Knowledge is passed through oral traditions, and the world is largely unexplored and perilous. The Shapers are distant memories, almost myths themselves. The first rudimentary forms of societal structures begin to emerge, often tribal and nomadic.
    *   *Key Event Types:* Celestial/Cosmic events heavily influence early beliefs; minor Disasters/Destructions shape early settlements; first tentative Expeditions into nearby territories.
*   **The Age of First Footfalls (-8,000 to -5,000 OR):** Mortal races begin to establish more permanent settlements. Rudimentary agriculture and animal husbandry develop in fertile regions like parts of Aethelgard and Sylvandell. The first true cultures begin to differentiate themselves. Early interactions between different groups occur, sometimes peaceful, often not. The earliest forms of Echo-manipulation (proto-magic) are discovered.
    *   *Key Event Types:* Founding of first villages; Construction beginning/end of simple fortifications; early forms of Criminal Activity (inter-tribal raiding); Extinction of some megafauna due to early hunting pressures.

## II. The Age of Ascendance (Approx. -5,000 to -1,000 OR)

*   **The Age of Kingdoms (-5,000 to -2,500 OR):** Larger societal structures, including the first kingdoms and city-states, emerge. Aethelgard sees the rise of petty kings. Kharadumite city-states begin to exploit geothermal resources. Valdorian clans consolidate. The Shifting Sands see the rise of early oasis-based trading posts. Written language develops in several cultures.
    *   *Key Event Types:* Founding of cities and nations; Diplomatic Actions (early treaties and alliances, declarations of small-scale wars); Construction of significant monuments and fortifications; Era Beginning/End for many tribal societies as they are absorbed or evolve.
*   **The Age of Echoes Awoken (-2,500 to -1,000 OR):** A period of significant magical discovery and development. The Order of the Twin Flames begins to codify its beliefs in Aethelgard. Xylos and Sylvandell see the flourishing of nature-based magic. Pyrosian cultures learn to harness volcanic energies. The Sky-Reaches see the first attempts at taming sky-beasts. This era also sees the first major conflicts fueled by magical power.
    *   *Key Event Types:* Founding of magical orders and schools; Disasters/Destructions caused by uncontrolled magic; major Expeditions to seek sources of Echoes; Civil Actions as common folk react to the rise of powerful magic-users.

## III. The Oracle Era (Approx. -1,000 OR to Present Day)

*   **The First King's Folly & The Oracle's Rise (Approx. -1,000 to -950 OR):** A pivotal period. The first self-proclaimed High King of Aethelgard attempts to seize absolute power using forbidden Echoes, leading to widespread conflict and devastation. A coalition of nobles and nascent spiritual leaders, guided by the first Oracle, overthrows the tyrant. The Oracle is formally established as an institution to prevent such abuses of power.
    *   *Key Event Types:* Major War (The Tyrant King's War); Diplomatic Action (formation of the anti-tyrant coalition); Disbandment of the Tyrant King's regime; Founding of the Oracle; Era Beginning for a new form of political oversight.
*   **The Age of Consolidation (Approx. -950 OR to -200 OR):** The major powers of Crayteria solidify their borders and internal structures. The Order of the Twin Flames expands its influence. Trade routes become more established, particularly through Serenissima and the Shifting Sands. Significant advancements in technology and craftsmanship occur in Kharadum and Aethelgard. The great houses of Aethelgard cement their power.
    *   *Key Event Types:* Construction of major infrastructure (roads, canals, grand temples); Financial Events (establishment of currencies, major trade agreements); Civil Actions (peasant revolts, guild formations); Diplomatic Actions (long-standing treaties, dynastic marriages).
*   **The Sundered Centuries (Approx. -200 OR to 0 OR - The Sundering):** A period of increasing tension and large-scale conflicts across multiple continents. This culminates in **The Great Sundering**, a series of cataclysmic wars and magical disasters that reshape political landscapes and leave deep scars on the world. The exact nature and full extent of the Sundering vary in regional histories, but it marks a significant turning point. Many ancient lines are broken, and new powers emerge from the ashes.
    *   *Key Event Types:* Multiple major Wars; Disasters/Destructions (magical and mundane); Extinction of some minor cultures or noble lines; Era End for the Age of Consolidation; Civil Actions (mass migrations, refugee crises).
*   **The Age of Reckoning (Approx. 0 OR to Present Day - Currently ~500 OR):** The current era. The peoples of Crayteria are still dealing with the aftermath of the Sundering. Efforts are made to rebuild, forge new alliances, and understand the changed world. The Oracle plays a crucial role in mediating disputes and guiding reconstruction. New threats and opportunities emerge. The narrative present of Crayteria falls within this age.
    *   *Key Event Types:* Ongoing Construction/Reconstruction efforts; Diplomatic Actions (new alliances, uneasy truces); Expeditions into territories altered by the Sundering; Financial Events (economic recovery, new trade patterns); Civil Actions (movements for reform, rise of new ideologies); potential for new Era Beginning as the world settles into its post-Sundering state.

This outline provides a broad framework. Specific events, wars, and cultural developments within each continent will further populate this timeline, creating a rich and detailed history for Crayteria.
