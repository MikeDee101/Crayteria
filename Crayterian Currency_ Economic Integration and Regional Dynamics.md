# Crayterian Currency: Economic Integration and Regional Dynamics

## Currency and Continental Economies

### Aethelgard: Order and Hierarchy
Aethelgard's economy reflects its ordered society, with strict regulation of currency and trade. The cidoki, co-developed with Kharadum, symbolizes Aethelgard's emphasis on stability and enduring value.

**Economic Characteristics:**
- Centralized banking system overseen by the Order of the Gilded Griffon
- Extensive record-keeping of transactions above 1 ab in value
- Taxation collected primarily in cidoki and ab from noble houses

- Lady-Knight Iluns Nidacan's military campaigns are funded through a special "defense levy" of 1/20th cidoki per noble house annually

### Serenissima: Fluid Commerce
Serenissima's wind-influenced society is reflected in its fluid approach to currency and commerce, with the ab serving as the primary unit of significant trade.

**Economic Characteristics:**
- Minimal regulation of currency exchange between floating cities

## Cross-Continental Trade and Currency Flow

The movement of currency across Crayteria creates complex economic relationships between regions:

### Currency and Political Power

Control over currency production and flow represents significant political power in Crayteria:

1. **The Oracle's Monetary Authority**
   - Controls official exchange rates
   - Authorizes regional mints
   - Maintains strategic reserves of all currencies
   - Funds major cross-continental projects
   - Example: The recent standardization of cidoki purity required all existing coins to be reminted, allowing the Oracle to assess total cidoki circulation

3. **Guild and Merchant Influence**
   - Craft guilds in Kharadum influence cidoki production
   - Merchant consortia in Serenissima sometimes create private currency notes
   - Banking houses can affect regional currency availability through lending practices
   - Example: Superior Isaph's metallurgical innovations have been gradually implemented in all cidoki, increasing the guild's influence over currency standards

4. **Religious and Cultural Factors**
   - Solara's sun temples influence ab circulation through donation cycles
   - Pyros' fire festivals temporarily alter normal currency use
   - Shifting Sands' temporal anomalies create unique currency phenomena
   - Example: Emira Adassai Dawah's astronomical calendar project will potentially create new "auspicious days" for major transactions, affecting currency flow
