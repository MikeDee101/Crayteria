# Crayterian Ballads: Complete Lyrics

## 1. "The Devout Wife's Folly"
*A comedic ballad from Serenissima, sung by an alto about drunken revelry, a devout heroine's husband, a dragonfly, and a compassionate mercenary.*

### Verse 1
In Serenissima's misty square,
Where wind-songs dance through evening air,
A pious man named Theron prayed,
While his good wife at home had stayed.
But Lyra fair had other plans,
Than weaving by her husband's hands.

### Verse 2
"To market, market," she declared,
Though Festival of Winds had flared.
With basket clutched and virtues tight,
She stepped into the wild night.
Where revelers danced without a care,
And scents of wine perfumed the air.

### Verse 3
A dragonfly with wings of blue,
Caught Lyra's eye—a sign most true!
"The Goddess sends a messenger!"
She gasped, her vision starting to blur.
She followed it to tavern's door,
Where she had never been before.

### Verse 4
"Just one small cup to warm my bones,"
She whispered, hushing inner groans.
But one became two, then three, then four,
Till Lyra danced upon the floor!
Her headscarf lost, her laughter free,
A sight her husband shouldn't see!

### Verse 5
A mercenary, scarred but kind,
Saw trouble brewing close behind.
For Theron, finished with his prayers,
Was heading home, unaware!
"Quick, goodwife, hide behind this cart,
Your husband comes with pious heart!"

### Verse 6
The dragonfly returned once more,
As Theron passed the tavern door.
It led him on a merry chase,
Away from his wife's flushed face!
The mercenary winked and smiled,
"The Goddess works in ways quite wild.
Next Festival, I'll save your place—
But maybe drink with slower pace!"

## 2. "The Healer's Feast"
*A bittersweet ballad from Aethelgard, sung by a soprano accompanied by a pair of flutes about a physician, a feast, an oddball tailor, and a dove.*

### Verse 1
In Aethelgard where starlight gleams,
And order reigns o'er mortal dreams,
A healer worked with hands of grace,
Her heart a cold and empty space.
Twin flutes play soft, twin flutes play low,
For joys and sorrows come and go.

### Verse 2
Her patients lived while loved ones died,
The balance that she couldn't hide.
Each autumn when the leaves turned gold,
She'd set a feast, as was foretold.
Twin flutes play soft, twin flutes play low,
For joys and sorrows come and go.

### Verse 3
An empty chair for each one lost,
A plate of food at bitter cost.
She'd dine alone among the ghosts,
The healer playing grieving host.
Twin flutes play soft, twin flutes play low,
For joys and sorrows come and go.

### Verse 4
One evening as the feast was laid,
A tailor knocked, seemed unafraid.
His clothes mismatched, his smile askew,
"Your curtains torn, I'll mend them new."
Twin flutes play soft, twin flutes play low,
For joys and sorrows come and go.

### Verse 5
He saw the chairs, the plates untouched,
"A feast for many!" he remarked.
"I've lost them all," she whispered then,
"Despite my herbs and healing ken."
Twin flutes play soft, twin flutes play low,
For joys and sorrows come and go.

### Verse 6
The tailor sat in empty chair,
"I too know loss beyond repair.
But threads can mend what seems undone,
And hearts can heal with rising sun."
Twin flutes play soft, twin flutes play low,
For joys and sorrows come and go.

### Verse 7
A dove flew in through open door,
Then two, then three, then many more.
They perched on chairs where ghosts had sat,
The healer smiled—imagine that!
Twin flutes play high, twin flutes play clear,
For peace comes when we face our fear.

## 3. "Gems in the Rough"
*A nonsensical drinking song from Kharadum, sung by a baritone accompanied by a fiddle about an energetic apprentice, a broken-hearted artist, and gems.*

### Verse 1
HEAVE-HO! The hammer falls!
In Kharadum's stone halls!
An apprentice with fire in his eyes,
Dug deeper than wisdom advise!
Found gems and rocks and stones so tough,
We're all just gems in the rough!
*DRINK! DRINK! DRINK!*

### Verse 2
HEAVE-HO! The chisel breaks!
The fiddle bends and shakes!
An artist with heart split in twain,
Carved beauty from unbearable pain!
Her tears turned hard as diamonds bright,
We'll drink to her gems tonight!
*DRINK! DRINK! DRINK!*

### Verse 3
HEAVE-HO! The mountains sing!
The precious metals ring!
The apprentice and artist they met,
In a tavern where miners get wet!
They argued and fought and fell in love,
While the fiddle screeched above!
*DRINK! DRINK! DRINK!*

### Verse 4
HEAVE-HO! Now raise your cup!
And drink the whole thing up!
For deep in the earth or deep in your heart,
The gems and the cracks can't be part!
We're polished by troubles, we shine through our tears,
So drink to the gem-making years!
*DRINK! DRINK! DRINK!*

## 4. "The Hunter's Lament"
*An emotional ballad from Sylvandell, sung by an alto accompanied by a reed and a drum about a shortbow, a whip, and a treasure chest.*

### Verse 1
Deep in Sylvandell's ancient wood,
Where shadow-paths are understood,
A hunter with a shortbow true,
Sought prey beneath the sky so blue.
The reed pipe mourns, the soft drum beats,
As forest heart with sorrow greets.

### Verse 2
Her arrows swift, her aim was sure,
Her family's needs she would secure.
But deeper in the woods she went,
Beyond where others' steps were spent.
The reed pipe mourns, the soft drum beats,
As forest heart with sorrow greets.

### Verse 3
A glimmer caught her eager eye,
A treasure chest, she heard it sigh.
With gems and gold beyond compare,
No more would hunger be her share.
The reed pipe mourns, the soft drum beats,
As forest heart with sorrow greets.

### Verse 4
But guarding it with eyes of flame,
A beast no hunter e'er could tame.
It carried whip of living vine,
That through the air did crack and twine.
The reed pipe mourns, the soft drum beats,
As forest heart with sorrow greets.

### Verse 5
"Stand back," it growled, "this chest is cursed,
With greed that brings a hunger worse
Than empty bellies, hollow bones—
It feeds on dreams and turns hearts stone."
The reed pipe mourns, the soft drum beats,
As forest heart with sorrow greets.

### Verse 6
The hunter notched her shortbow then,
"My children starve in woodland glen.
This treasure will their suffering end,
Their future paths it will amend."
The reed pipe mourns, the soft drum beats,
As forest heart with sorrow greets.

### Verse 7
The whip lashed out, the bow string sang,
Through forest deep their battle rang.
The chest began to glow and hum,
As reed pipe wailed and beat the drum.
The reed pipe mourns, the soft drum beats,
As forest heart with sorrow greets.

### Verse 8
The hunter fell, her blood ran free,
Her final thoughts of family.
The beast approached with solemn tread,
"The chest claims all," it softly said.
The reed pipe mourns, the soft drum beats,
As forest heart with sorrow greets.

### Verse 9
It touched her brow with gentle claw,
"Your courage breaks the ancient law.
The chest was test, not treasure true,
The forest sees what's pure in you."
The reed pipe sings, the soft drum beats,
As forest heart with wonder greets.

### Verse 10
Her wounds were healed by forest's grace,
A different treasure took their place.
Knowledge of paths and plants that heal,
Secrets the woods would now reveal.
The reed pipe sings, the soft drum beats,
As forest heart with wonder greets.

### Verse 11
So hunters, heed this solemn tale,
When treasure gleams in wooded vale.
True wealth lies not in chests of gold,
But in the wisdom forests hold.
The reed pipe sings, the soft drum fades,
As hunter's spirit finds new ways.

## 5. "The Rabbit's Riddle"
*A convoluted ballad from the Shifting Sands about a rowan tree, a rabbit, and a painting.*

In Shifting Sands where time bends back,
A rabbit white with markings black,
Sat beneath a rowan tree,
That yesterday did not yet be.
The rabbit spoke in riddles deep,
To painter who had come to seek
The truth behind the desert's veil,
Where memories both form and fail.

"Paint me as I am," said he,
"But I am not what you can see.
For I'm the moon, the stars, the sun,
I'm everything and yet I'm none."
The painter mixed her colors bright,
Confusion blurred her artist's sight.
The rowan tree began to sing,
Of futures past and what they bring.

The painting changed with every stroke,
The rabbit laughed as if in joke.
The tree's red berries turned to gold,
Then back to seeds, then back to old.
"You cannot paint what shifts and turns,
You cannot hold what lives and burns.
The desert knows no single truth,
No age of death, no age of youth."

When dawn broke o'er the dunes of time,
The painter woke as bells did chime.
Her canvas showed a simple scene:
A rowan tree in field of green,
No rabbit there, no desert vast,
No riddles of the future-past.
But in her heart, she understood
The truths that defy brush and wood.

## 6. "The Acrobat's Blades"
*A sweet yet adult ballad from Pyros, sung by a bass accompanied by a lyre about crossed blades, a stone, a famous acrobat, and a crossbow.*

### Verse 1
In Pyros where the embers glow,
And passions like the magma flow,
An acrobat of great renown,
Would set ablaze each eager town.
The lyre plays soft, the bass voice hums,
As night of pleasure slowly comes.

### Verse 2
With muscles taut and grace divine,
His body like the finest wine,
He'd dance between two crossed steel blades,
As crowds would watch with breath delayed.
The lyre plays soft, the bass voice hums,
As night of pleasure slowly comes.

### Verse 3
A noblewoman clutched a stone,
A keepsake she had always known.
It burned against her palm that night,
As acrobat came into sight.
The lyre plays soft, the bass voice hums,
As night of pleasure slowly comes.

### Verse 4
Their eyes met o'er the dangerous dance,
A moment more than simple chance.
Later as the crowds dispersed,
She sought him out, with desire cursed.
The lyre plays soft, the bass voice hums,
As night of pleasure slowly comes.

### Verse 5
"My crossbow's cocked," he whispered low,
"My aim is true, as you shall know.
But tell me of the stone you hold,
What secrets does its heart enfold?"
The lyre plays deep, the bass voice thrums,
As night of passion fiercely comes.

### Verse 6
"This stone," she said, "marks noble birth,
But tonight it has no worth.
I seek not titles, wealth, or fame,
But skill that puts my own to shame."
The lyre plays deep, the bass voice thrums,
As night of passion fiercely comes.

### Verse 7
What happened next, we dare not say,
In mixed company light of day.
But blades were crossed and bows were drawn,
And neither left until the dawn.
The lyre falls silent, the bass voice stills,
As memory the passion fills.
