# The Crimson Festival: Revised Opening with Oracle Twist

## Prologue: Shadows in the Oracle's Chamber

*Three weeks before the Festival of Renewal*

The Circle of Nine gathered in the Inner Sanctum of the Oracle's Tower, their faces illuminated only by the pale blue light emanating from the Echo Pool at the chamber's center. The liquid within the pool did not reflect their faces but instead swirled with images too fleeting for an untrained eye to discern.

"The vision persists," said the First Sage, her weathered hands gripping the edge of the ancient stone basin. "The child of Alaric and Elara will grow to challenge us. Not today, not tomorrow, but inevitably."

Morvain, the Vessel of Shadows, moved closer to the pool, his dark robes absorbing the ethereal light. "Show us again," he commanded, his voice barely above a whisper.

The First Sage passed her hand over the surface of the pool. The liquid stilled momentarily before new images formed: a crown shattered, a child with eyes that reflected the Echoes themselves, and the Oracle Tower crumbling stone by stone.

"The bloodline of Theron grows too independent," said Morvain. "Three generations they have slowly pushed us from their councils, questioned our guidance, restricted our access to Aethelgard's resources. And now this child..." He gestured to the pool where the image of an infant with unusually bright eyes had formed.

"We have always been patient," cautioned another member of the Circle. "Perhaps we should observe longer before acting."

"The convergence comes with the Festival of Renewal," Morvain replied sharply. "Such an alignment occurs once in three centuries. If we are to act, it must be then, when the veil between the Echoes and our world thins, when royal blood spilled will yield the greatest harvest."

The First Sage straightened, her face betraying no emotion though her eyes remained fixed on the swirling visions. "What do you propose, Vessel of Shadows?"

Morvain's thin lips curved into a smile. "Lord Valerius has ambition but lacks courage. With proper... encouragement, he could become the instrument we require. And we have assets already positioned—the squire Kael, the agent we call Whisper."

"And the child?" asked the First Sage.

"The child must be secured, not eliminated," Morvain replied. "Such rare attunement to the Echoes could be useful if properly controlled. We will substitute a changeling and raise the true heir under our guidance."

Silence fell over the chamber as the Circle considered the proposal. Finally, the First Sage nodded once. "Proceed with caution, Vessel of Shadows. The Oracle must remain above suspicion. No evidence of our hand in this matter can ever come to light."

"Of course," Morvain bowed slightly. "When has the Oracle ever left evidence of its true work?"

As the Circle dispersed, the Echo Pool settled into stillness, but one final image lingered longer than the others—a festival banner stained with blood.

## Chapter 1: The Festival of Renewal

The second day of the Festival of Renewal dawned bright over Aerthos, capital of Aethelgard. Colorful banners bearing the symbol of Lyra, Goddess of Life and Growth, fluttered from every tower and rooftop. The air carried the mingled scents of incense, fresh bread, and spring blossoms. In the streets, citizens wore their finest clothes adorned with fresh flowers, their faces painted with symbols of rebirth and fertility.

In a small chamber within the Oracle Tower overlooking the city square, a woman known to few as Mara and to her handlers as Whisper made final preparations. She applied a thin layer of ash to her face, carefully creating the appearance of someone who had not slept or eaten well for days. Her plain dress was deliberately torn in places, smudged with dirt from the road.

"You understand your role?" asked the hooded figure standing in the shadows of the room.

"Perfectly," Mara replied, her voice now practiced in the trembling cadence of fear. "I am to be caught attempting to steal bread from a festival stall. When brought before the magistrate, I will claim desperation drove me to it—my children are starving in a village three days' ride from here."

"The magistrate has been instructed to sentence you to public execution, regardless of your plea," the figure continued. "The timing will be precise. Prince Alaric should be returning from his hunt just as you are brought to the block."

"And if he does not intervene?" Mara asked, though she already knew the answer.

"The executioner will receive a signal to stay his hand at the last moment. But Prince Alaric will intervene. His compassion during the sacred festival is... predictable." The figure handed her a small vial. "If you are taken to the palace dungeons as expected, place three drops of this in the prince's wine when the opportunity arises. It will make him more susceptible to suggestion in the chaos to come."

Mara tucked the vial into a hidden pocket. "And the child?"

"Is not your concern unless circumstances change dramatically. Lord Valerius's men will secure the infant. You are simply to remain positioned for contingencies." The figure moved toward the door. "Remember, you have served the Oracle faithfully for seven years. Success in this mission will earn you elevation to the Bronze Eye."

After the figure departed, Mara studied her reflection one final time. The woman who gazed back appeared pitiful, desperate—the perfect object for a prince's mercy. No one would suspect her true purpose. She touched the Oracle's mark tattooed on the inside of her wrist, now concealed beneath layers of grime and a tattered sleeve, and whispered the oath of service before heading down to take her position.

---

In the royal hunting party returning to Aerthos, Prince Alaric rode at the front, a leather pouch containing the precious Sunpetal bloom secured carefully to his belt. The hunt had been successful, though more challenging than the ancient text had suggested. Four days they had tracked the elusive flower through the northern reaches of the Whispering Woods, following signs that seemed to appear and disappear with uncanny timing.

"A worthy prize for the princess, my lord," said Kael, riding close behind. The squire's eyes constantly scanned their surroundings, a habit that had impressed Alaric when he first selected the young man for his service.

"Elara will be pleased," Alaric replied, patting the pouch. "The healers say the Sunpetal's properties are unmatched for restoring a woman's strength after childbirth."

What Alaric did not see was the subtle exchange of glances between Kael and one of the Oracle's observers who had accompanied the hunting party, ostensibly to document the rare bloom for their botanical archives.

As they approached the city gates, the sounds of the festival reached them—music, laughter, the calls of merchants. Alaric smiled, his thoughts turning to his wife and the child that would be born any day now. The future seemed bright, secure. The dynasty of Theron would continue, and Aethelgard would prosper under its guidance.

The hunting party entered the city to cheers and flower petals thrown by celebrating citizens. Alaric waved, his popularity evident in the genuine warmth of the reception. They made their way toward the palace, but as they crossed the main square, a commotion drew their attention.

A crowd had gathered around the public execution block. This was unusual—executions were typically suspended during the Festival of Renewal out of respect for Lyra's celebration of life. Alaric frowned and directed his horse toward the disturbance.

A woman knelt at the block, her head bowed, a city guard standing ready with an axe. The magistrate was reading charges—theft, apparently, though during the festival such minor offenses were typically punished with community service rather than death.

"Halt!" Alaric's voice carried across the square. The crowd parted as he dismounted and approached the block. "What is the meaning of this? Do we not honor the Goddess of Life during her sacred week?"

The magistrate bowed low, though Alaric did not notice the man's eyes darting briefly toward a figure watching from the shadows of a nearby alley—an Oracle observer giving a subtle nod.

"My Prince, this woman stole from a festival merchant. The law—"

"The law recognizes the sanctity of the festival," Alaric interrupted. "No life shall be taken during the Week of Renewal. This has been our custom since my grandfather's time."

He turned to the kneeling woman, who kept her head bowed, her body trembling convincingly. "Look at me," he said, his tone gentler.

Mara raised her head slowly, her eyes wide with practiced fear and desperate hope.

"What drove you to steal during the festival?" Alaric asked.

"My children, my lord," she whispered, her voice breaking. "Three days' ride from here, in a village struck by fever. I came seeking medicine, but had no coin left for food."

From his position several paces behind, Kael watched the exchange with a carefully neutral expression. He had been briefed on this woman's appearance in the square but told only that she would play a role in coming events. Like most pawns in the Oracle's grand game, he knew only his part, not the full design.

Alaric's face softened with compassion. "No one should hunger during the Festival of Renewal." He turned to the magistrate. "Release her to the palace dungeons. After the festival concludes, I will review her case personally."

He addressed Mara directly. "You will be fed and treated well until then. When the festival ends, we will discuss how to help your children."

As the guards helped Mara to her feet, Alaric did not see the flash of satisfaction in her eyes, quickly masked by tears of apparent gratitude. "The Goddess bless you, my Prince," she said, her voice carrying just enough for the approving crowd to hear.

Alaric nodded and remounted his horse, continuing toward the palace with his entourage. As they rode, Kael moved his mount alongside the prince's.

"A merciful decision, my lord," the squire said.

"It was the only proper choice during the festival," Alaric replied. "Besides, there was something in her eyes... a mother's desperation. I could not ignore such suffering, not with my own child about to enter the world."

Kael nodded, his expression thoughtful. "Indeed, my lord. Every child deserves a chance at life."

The irony of his words would only become apparent hours later, when blood stained the palace floors and the carefully orchestrated chaos of the Oracle's design was unleashed upon the unsuspecting royal family.

---

In the palace, King Theron paced the council chamber, his thoughts far from matters of state. His first grandchild was due any day, and the excitement had made it difficult to focus on the reports his advisors presented.

"Your Majesty seems distracted," observed Lord Valerius, the King's Councilor for Defense. His tone was respectful, but those who knew him well might have detected a note of calculation in his pale eyes.

"My apologies, Lord Valerius," Theron replied with a smile. "The imminent arrival of an heir tends to occupy an old man's thoughts."

"Understandable, Your Majesty. The continuation of your line is cause for celebration throughout Aethelgard."

What King Theron could not know was that for months, Valerius had been receiving visitors in the dead of night—Oracle agents who whispered of ancient claims, of the Karthis lineage's rightful place on the throne, of evidence suggesting the King planned to remove him from the council. Each visit left Valerius more convinced, more resentful, more ambitious. The subtle Echo-manipulation employed during these visits ensured the seeds of treason took root and flourished.

The council session concluded, and as the advisors filed out, a messenger arrived announcing Prince Alaric's return. Theron's face brightened. "Send him to me as soon as he has refreshed himself from the journey."

In his private chamber adjacent to the council room, Valerius met briefly with the captain of his personal guard. "Are the men in position?" he asked quietly.

"Yes, my lord. They await only your signal."

Valerius nodded. "When the bells ring for the evening meal, we move. Not before."

The captain bowed and departed, leaving Valerius alone with his thoughts. He removed a small medallion from beneath his robes—an ancient symbol of the Karthis house that an Oracle agent had "discovered" in historical archives and presented to him months ago. He ran his thumb over the worn surface, imagining how it would look displayed prominently in the throne room once again.

He did not realize he was merely the most visible instrument in a complex mechanism designed by unseen hands—a blade that would fall precisely when and where the Oracle desired.

---

In her chambers, Princess Elara lay propped against pillows, her swollen belly making any position uncomfortable. Her handmaiden Lyra adjusted the cushions behind her back.

"The midwife says it could be any day now, perhaps even tonight," Elara said, wincing as the baby kicked forcefully.

"A strong child," Lyra observed with a smile. "Worthy of Aethelgard's throne."

"If it's a boy," Elara sighed. "Though Alaric says he would be equally pleased with a daughter."

"The Prince is a progressive man," Lyra agreed. She had served Elara since childhood and was more friend than servant. "I hear his hunting party has returned. He found the Sunpetal."

Elara's face brightened. "Truly? The bloom is said to work wonders for a mother's recovery."

What neither woman knew was that the ancient text describing the Sunpetal's location and properties had been planted in the royal library by Oracle archivists just months earlier, after being treated with compounds that would make its pages appear aged by centuries. The bloom itself, while beautiful and somewhat beneficial, had been cultivated in the Oracle's hidden gardens and subtly enhanced with Echo-infused elements that would allow them to monitor and potentially influence the child's developing Echo-sensitivity.

A knock at the door announced Alaric's arrival. He entered, still dusty from the road but beaming with joy. He crossed to Elara's bed and kissed her tenderly before producing the leather pouch.

"The Sunpetal, as promised," he said, carefully removing the delicate golden bloom.

Elara gasped with delight. "It's beautiful!"

"I'll take it to the healers immediately," Alaric said. "They'll prepare it properly for after the birth." He handed the bloom to Lyra. "Please ensure this reaches the royal herbalist."

As Lyra departed with the precious flower, Alaric sat beside his wife, placing a gentle hand on her belly. "How are you feeling?"

"Ready to meet our child," she replied with a tired smile. "Did anything interesting happen while you were away?"

Alaric told her about the woman he had saved from execution, explaining his decision to review her case after the festival.

"Always compassionate," Elara said fondly. "It's why the people love you."

"It was the right thing to do, especially during the Festival of Renewal," he replied. "There was something about her... a desperation I couldn't ignore."

In the corridor outside, Lyra delivered the Sunpetal to the royal herbalist, unaware that the elderly man had been replaced three months earlier with an Oracle agent skilled in botanical manipulation. The false herbalist accepted the bloom with appropriate reverence, promising to prepare it according to ancient tradition.

As soon as Lyra departed, he examined the flower carefully, confirming the subtle markers that identified it as the specific plant cultivated for this purpose. Everything was proceeding according to design. The bloom would be prepared and ready to administer to Princess Elara after she gave birth—ensuring the Oracle's influence would extend to the child from its first moments of life.

But fate, it seemed, had other plans.

---

In the palace dungeons, Mara sat quietly in her cell, observing the guards' patterns and listening to their conversations. She had been fed well, as the Prince had ordered, and treated with unexpected kindness. This made her task simultaneously easier and more difficult—easier to move about without suspicion, more difficult to maintain her focus on the mission.

A guard approached with a fresh pitcher of water. "The Prince said you were to be treated well," he explained, sliding the pitcher through the small opening in the cell door.

"Please convey my gratitude to His Highness," Mara replied, maintaining her role as the grateful supplicant.

When the guard left, she removed the hidden vial from her sleeve. The liquid inside was clear, odorless, tasteless—a subtle Echo-enhanced compound that would make Prince Alaric more susceptible to confusion during the coup, increasing the likelihood he would be captured rather than escaping. She had been instructed to find a way to administer it before the evening meal.

An opportunity presented itself sooner than expected. A commotion erupted in the corridor—shouts of joy, congratulations. Mara pressed against the bars to listen.

"The Princess has gone into labor!" a guard announced. "The heir comes tonight!"

The guards began celebrating, passing around cups of wine to toast the imminent birth. In the excitement, they even offered a cup to Mara, "so you too can celebrate this blessed event."

She accepted gratefully, and when attention turned elsewhere, quickly added three drops from her vial to the cup she knew would be sent up to the Prince. The guard, too distracted by the celebration to notice, took the tray with the wine upstairs to the royal family.

Mara settled back on her bench, her part played for now. She would wait for the chaos to begin, ready to adapt to whatever contingencies arose. The Oracle had trained her well for this moment—years of preparation for a single night that would reshape the destiny of Aethelgard.

---

As evening fell, the palace was abuzz with activity. Princess Elara's labor had begun in earnest, with the midwife and her assistants attending in the royal bedchamber. King Theron had summoned the council to the great hall, ostensibly to await news of the birth, though many suspected he simply wanted company during the anxious wait.

Prince Alaric alternated between his wife's bedside and the great hall, his face showing both excitement and concern. When a servant brought wine to calm his nerves, he drank deeply, not noticing the slightly bitter aftertaste—evidence of Mara's tampering.

In the great hall, Lord Valerius watched the Prince carefully, noting the subtle changes in his demeanor as the Echo-enhanced compound began to take effect. Alaric's movements became slightly less coordinated, his attention more difficult to maintain. To most observers, he simply appeared to be an anxious father-to-be, perhaps having drunk too much wine to steady his nerves.

Kael, standing dutifully near his master, also observed these changes. He had been told to expect them, though not their cause. His instructions were clear: when the bells rang for the evening meal, he was to ensure Prince Alaric remained in the great hall, separated from any loyal guards.

As the palace bells began to toll, a cry went up from the royal bedchamber. Moments later, a beaming midwife appeared at the great hall entrance.

"A healthy son!" she announced. "The Princess has delivered a strong, healthy boy!"

King Theron rose from his seat, his face alight with joy. "Praise be to Lyra! The line continues!"

The hall erupted in cheers and congratulations. Prince Alaric, despite the fog beginning to cloud his mind, felt a surge of pure happiness. He embraced his father, then turned to address the assembled nobles.

"Tonight, we celebrate not just the Festival of Renewal, but the renewal of our very dynasty! I go now to see my son and wife."

As Alaric moved toward the door, Kael stepped forward as instructed, placing a hand on his arm. "My Prince, perhaps a moment to compose yourself first? You seem... affected by the wine."

It was in this moment of distraction that Lord Valerius gave the signal. His personal guards, positioned strategically throughout the hall, drew their weapons. The doors were secured. The trap was sprung.

"What is the meaning of this?" King Theron demanded, his voice cutting through the sudden silence.

Lord Valerius stepped forward, his face a mask of cold determination. "The meaning, Your Majesty, is the correction of a historical injustice. The Karthis line was the true royal house of Aethelgard, usurped generations ago. Tonight, I reclaim what is rightfully mine."

As guards loyal to Valerius seized council members known to be loyal to the King, Alaric struggled to clear his head, the drugged wine making his thoughts sluggish. He reached for his sword, only to find Kael's hand already there, preventing him from drawing it.

"Kael?" he questioned, confusion and the first hint of betrayal in his eyes.

"Forgive me, my Prince," the squire said quietly. "But some loyalties run deeper than others."

What no one in the hall could see were the Oracle observers positioned in hidden alcoves, watching the coup unfold exactly as designed. Their Echo-enhanced perception allowed them to monitor the flow of events, ready to subtly intervene if necessary to keep the plan on course.

In the royal bedchamber, Princess Elara cradled her newborn son, unaware of the bloodshed beginning in the great hall. Lyra, however, sensed something amiss when the sounds of celebration turned to shouts and the clash of steel.

"Something is wrong," she whispered, moving to the door. She opened it a crack, then quickly closed it again, her face pale. "Armed men in the corridor. Not the royal guard."

Elara clutched her child tighter. "What's happening?"

Before Lyra could answer, Prince Alaric burst into the room, having broken free in the confusion. Blood stained his sleeve from a shallow wound, and his eyes were wild with a combination of fear and the lingering effects of the drugged wine.

"Elara," he gasped. "Valerius has betrayed us. Father is captured. We must get you and the child to safety."

He moved to the bed, his gaze falling on his son for the first time. Despite the dire circumstances, his face softened momentarily. "He's beautiful," he whispered.

The moment was shattered by the sound of armored footsteps in the corridor. Alaric's expression hardened as he made a swift decision. He scribbled a hasty note and pressed it into Lyra's hand.

"Take my son," he commanded. "Flee Aerthos. Find the woman I spared in the square. She will understand desperation. She may offer aid. Go, and never look back!"

Lyra hesitated only briefly before nodding. She had served the royal family her entire life; she would not fail them now. She took the swaddled infant from Elara's trembling arms.

"No," Elara protested weakly, still exhausted from childbirth. "I cannot leave my child."

"You must stay with Alaric," Lyra said firmly. "I will protect your son with my life. When it is safe, I will return him to you."

Alaric embraced his wife. "Trust Lyra. Our son must survive, even if we do not."

As the sounds of fighting drew closer, Lyra wrapped the infant securely and slipped through a servant's passage hidden behind a tapestry—a route known to few outside the royal family and their most trusted servants. The passage would lead her eventually to the palace kitchens, and from there, she hoped, to the city beyond.

In the bedchamber, Alaric drew his sword and positioned himself before the main door, ready to buy time for Lyra's escape. Elara, despite her weakened state, reached for a dagger kept in her bedside table.

"If we are to die," she said with quiet dignity, "let us die as rulers of Aethelgard should—facing our enemies."

Alaric looked at his wife with profound love and respect. "Together, then."

The door burst open, and Lord Valerius entered, flanked by his guards and a stone-faced Kael.

"Where is the child?" Valerius demanded.

Alaric's smile was grim. "Beyond your reach, traitor."

Valerius's face contorted with rage. "Search the room! The child must be found!"

As guards tore apart the chamber looking for the hidden infant, Valerius approached the royal couple. "Your defiance changes nothing. The Karthis line will rule Aethelgard once more. Your deaths will simply be the first step in restoring proper order."

What Valerius did not know—what even the Oracle's agents observing from the shadows did not immediately realize—was that in the confusion, their carefully laid plan had already begun to unravel. The infant prince was now in the hands of a loyal handmaiden, heading not toward their waiting agents but into the unpredictable chaos of a city in turmoil.

And in the palace dungeons, Mara received the signal that the coup had begun. She prepared to play her final role in the night's events, unaware that she would soon face a choice that had not been accounted for in the Oracle's meticulous design—a choice that would alter the course of Crayteria's future in ways even the Oracle's seers had not foreseen.
