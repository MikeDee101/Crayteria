# Veo 3 Video Prompt: The Crimson Festival of Aethelgard

A cinematic scene set during the Festival of Renewal in Aerthos, capital city of Aethelgard. The scene unfolds in a medieval fantasy city square filled with celebration and hidden intrigue.

## Setting & Atmosphere
The grand city square of Aerthos during golden hour, with warm sunlight casting long shadows across ancient cobblestones. Colorful banners bearing the symbol of Lyra (a flowering tree with roots forming a perfect circle) flutter from every building. The medieval architecture features tall stone buildings with peaked roofs, ornate wooden balconies, and a massive stone palace visible in the background. Market stalls line the edges of the square, selling flowers, bread, and festival trinkets.

The atmosphere is one of celebration tinged with hidden tension. Citizens in their finest medieval attire move through the square, many wearing flower crowns or with faces painted with fertility symbols. Children run with ribbons, musicians play flutes and drums, and the air is filled with flower petals that occasionally catch the light as they drift down. Incense smoke creates thin veils of haze that catch the golden sunlight.

## Characters & Positioning
In the center of the square is a stone execution block, where a woman (MARA) kneels with her head bowed. She wears a deliberately tattered dress, her face smudged with dirt and ash, her dark hair falling forward to partially obscure her face. A CITY GUARD stands beside her with an axe, while a MAGISTRATE in official robes reads from a scroll.

Entering the square from the left is PRINCE ALARIC, a handsome man in his early thirties with noble bearing, riding a chestnut horse. He wears riding clothes of fine quality with subtle royal insignia. Behind him rides his hunting party, including KAEL, a serious-faced young squire with watchful eyes. The crowd parts respectfully as they approach.

In the shadows of an alleyway to the right stands an ORACLE OBSERVER, a hooded figure in dark blue robes with subtle silver embroidery, barely visible but watching intently. Only their pale hands and the lower half of their face are visible beneath the hood.

The crowd forms a circle around the execution block, their expressions showing a mix of festival joy and concern at the unusual proceedings.

## Action & Movement
The scene captures the moment Prince Alaric raises his hand to halt the execution. His horse has just come to a stop, still settling with small movements. The Prince's expression shows righteous indignation transforming to compassion. The crowd is turning to look at him, some citizens throwing flower petals in his direction.

Mara is slowly raising her head, her expression transforming from feigned fear to carefully concealed calculation, though this should be subtle enough that only the viewer notices the deception. The magistrate is mid-bow, his eyes darting briefly toward the Oracle observer in the shadows.

The Oracle observer makes a subtle hand gesture, barely perceptible, signaling approval of how events are unfolding. Kael watches the entire scene with a carefully neutral expression that masks his complicity.

## Lighting & Color Palette
The scene is bathed in golden late afternoon light that creates dramatic shadows and highlights. The primary color palette includes:
- Rich reds and golds of the festival banners and royal insignia
- Earth tones of the cobblestone square and medieval buildings
- Vibrant greens and pinks of the festival flowers and garlands
- Deep blues and silvers of the Oracle's hidden presence
- The stark contrast of the dark execution block against the colorful celebration

Light catches on metal elements—the guard's axe, decorative armor, jewelry worn by citizens—creating points of brilliance throughout the scene.

## Symbolic Elements
Several symbolic elements should be visible:
- A festival banner with Lyra's symbol partially stained with what appears to be wine but foreshadows blood
- The Oracle's mark (a stylized eye within a nine-pointed star) subtly incorporated into architectural details
- The Sunpetal bloom partially visible in a pouch at Prince Alaric's belt, glowing with subtle golden light
- A palace tower in the background where a window shows the silhouette of a pregnant woman (Princess Elara)
- A raven perched on a nearby rooftop, watching the proceedings (representing the Oracle's vigilance)

## Camera Perspective
The scene is captured from a slightly elevated angle that allows the viewer to see the full square, the positioning of all key characters, and the palace in the background. The perspective creates a sense of witnessing a pivotal historical moment while also revealing the hidden machinations that the characters themselves cannot see.

## Emotional Tone
The emotional tone balances the surface joy of the festival with underlying tension and dramatic irony. The viewer should feel the weight of manipulation and impending tragedy beneath the colorful celebration—beauty on the verge of being shattered by conspiracy and violence.

## Technical Notes for Veo 3
- Ensure realistic medieval fantasy aesthetic with detailed textures on fabrics, stone, and wood
- Maintain photorealistic human faces with subtle, complex emotions
- Create dynamic lighting effects with the golden hour sunlight filtering through banners and incense smoke
- Include small ambient movements (fluttering banners, drifting petals, shifting crowd) to create a living scene
- Balance vibrant festival colors with more subdued tones for the conspiratorial elements
