The wind, carrying the scent of pine and damp earth, whistled through the battlements of Aerthos, the capital city of the Aethelgardian Kingdom. It was the second day of the Festival of Renewal, a sacred week dedicated to Lyra, the Goddess of Life and Growth. Yet, the festive air was tinged with an undercurrent of tension. Prince Alaric, his hunting leathers still dusty, rode through the city gates, a magnificent stag slung across his horse. He had been away for four days, seeking the rare Moonpetal flower, said to ease childbirth and ensure the health of both mother and child. His wife, Princess Lyra (named in honor of the goddess), was due to give birth any day. As he approached the city square, he saw a crowd gathered around a scaffold. A young woman, no older than his own Lyra, stood bound, awaiting execution. Her crime? Stealing bread to feed her starving family. Alaric, known for his compassion, felt a surge of anger. This was not how the sacred week should be observed. He dismounted, his loyal squire, Kael, at his side. Kael, a young man of common birth but uncommon skill with a blade, had a quiet intensity about him, a hint of a past he never spoke of. Alaric intervened, his voice ringing with authority. He declared that no life should be taken during the Festival of Renewal and ordered the woman to be imprisoned until the festival's end, when her case would be reviewed. He then made his way to the royal palace, his heart heavy despite the successful hunt. He found his father, King Theron, pacing in the great hall, his face etched with worry. The King, a man whose reign had been marked by peace and prosperity, was visibly shaken by the impending birth of his first grandchild. He greeted Alaric with a mixture of relief and anxiety. 



Moments later, a cheer erupted from the royal chambers. A healthy baby boy, the heir to Aethelgard, had been born. But the joy was short-lived. As Alaric and King Theron went to see the newborn, chaos erupted in the great hall. Lord Valerius, the King’s Councilor for Defense, a man long suspected of harboring ambitions far exceeding his station, made his move. His personal guard, strategically placed, drew their blades. Loyal council members were cut down where they stood. The palace, a sanctuary of peace, became a charnel house.

Alaric, reacting with the speed of a seasoned warrior, knew their situation was dire. He scribbled a hasty note, pressing it into the hand of Elara, Princess Lyra’s most trusted handmaiden. "Take my son," he whispered urgently, his eyes filled with a father's desperate love. "Flee Aerthos. Seek out the woman I spared in the square today. She will understand desperation. She may help you. Go, and never look back!"

Valerius, his face a mask of triumph, confronted the King and Prince. He demanded the whereabouts of the newborn heir. King Theron, his regal composure uncracked even in the face of death, refused. Alaric, standing beside his father, met Valerius’s gaze with cold defiance. Their silence sealed their fate. They were dragged to the city square, the same square where Alaric had shown mercy hours before, and publicly executed, their deaths a brutal spectacle meant to cow any resistance.

Kael, the squire, had been promised a restoration of his family’s name and honor for his part in Valerius’s scheme. His ancestor, a king banished during the First King’s Folly, had long been a source of shame for his hidden lineage. But Valerius, his promises as empty as his heart, had no intention of sharing power or glory. He ordered Kael’s death. The squire, beaten and near lifeless, was dragged to the Whispering Falls just outside Aerthos and hurled into the raging waters below, his supposed loyalty repaid with betrayal.

Far from the capital, Prince Theron’s twin brother, Commander Gareth, served with the King’s Northern Army. Weeks later, as news of the coup, carefully twisted by Valerius, began to filter through, an attempt was made on Gareth’s life, ordered by Valerius’s newly appointed military commanders. Gareth, a warrior as skilled as his brother, fought his way free, escaping with a band of his most loyal soldiers. They became fugitives, hunted by the usurper’s forces.

Their sister, Princess Anya, a devout Lector within the Order of the Twin Flames, was serving at a remote temple in the foothills of Valdoria when the horrific news reached her. Grief-stricken but resolute, she shed her sacred robes, disguised herself as a common traveler, and began the perilous journey back towards Aethelgard, her heart burning for justice and vengeance. Neither Gareth nor Anya knew of their nephew’s survival, nor the desperate flight of a loyal maid and a condemned criminal, now bound by fate and the future of a fallen kingdom. The stage was set for a saga of conflict, hidden identities, and the enduring hope for restoration in a world plunged into darkness.
