# The Prophecy and Rise of Rulthaar the Invincible

## The Prophecy of the Unifier

### Origins of the Prophecy

The prophecy that foretold Rulthaar's rise first emerged in the Shifting Sands approximately 350 years before the unification (-350 OR). Within the time-warped deserts, a temporal anomaly known as the Mirror Oasis appeared—a phenomenon where the waters reflected not the present but possible futures. The respected seer Kahlima of the Eternal Caliphate spent seven days and nights gazing into these waters, emerging with what would become known as the Prophecy of the Unifier.

The original prophecy, recorded in the Temporal Scrolls, stated:

> *"When the fractured lands bleed from a thousand wounds, there shall rise one born of humble earth but marked by the sky. Neither noble nor common shall be this one, but something new forged in the crucible of necessity. The Invincible shall come forth, bearing the Banner of Unity, and twelve great campaigns shall bring twelve lands under one crown. Only the twins of isolation shall remain apart, watching from their distant perches. The world shall know peace through strength, and the Unifier's line shall endure until the stars themselves change their course."*

### Spread and Interpretation

Initially dismissed as yet another vague prophecy among many, Kahlima's vision gained credibility when several of its minor predictions came to pass in the following decades:

- The "Bleeding of the Fractured Lands" was interpreted as the devastating Border Wars that erupted between Aethelgard and its neighbors in -320 OR
- The "Mark of the Sky" was associated with an unusual celestial event—a daylight comet visible across much of Crayteria in -315 OR
- The reference to "Neither noble nor common" suggested someone of mixed heritage or unusual social position

As these elements manifested, the prophecy spread beyond the Shifting Sands, translated into dozens of languages and interpreted through various cultural lenses. By the time of Rulthaar's birth, versions of the prophecy were known across most of Crayteria, though often dismissed by established powers as dangerous superstition.

### Political Impact

The prophecy had significant political ramifications even before Rulthaar's emergence:

- Several pretenders claimed to be the prophesied Unifier, leading to short-lived rebellions
- Some ruling houses attempted to fulfill the prophecy deliberately, launching expansionist campaigns
- Defensive alliances formed among smaller states fearing conquest by aspiring "Unifiers"
- Religious authorities debated whether the prophecy represented divine will or dangerous heresy

These reactions created a political environment primed for dramatic change, with populations increasingly expectant of a transformative figure and traditional power structures increasingly defensive against potential usurpers.

## Rulthaar's Early Life

### Origins and Childhood

Rulthaar was born in -280 OR in the contested borderlands between Aethelgard and Valdoria, a region known as the Marches. His origins embodied the "neither noble nor common" aspect of the prophecy:

- His mother, Elara, was a disgraced noblewoman from a minor Aethelgardian house, exiled for a forbidden romance
- His father, Torven, was a respected Valdorian warrior from the Stone Tribes, serving as a mercenary captain
- His birthplace was a military encampment during the Third Border War, literally on the contested frontier between realms

Rulthaar's childhood was shaped by constant movement and conflict. His father's mercenary company, the Granite Shields, served various employers across multiple continents, exposing young Rulthaar to diverse cultures, languages, and military traditions. His mother, meanwhile, ensured he received education typically reserved for nobility, including history, strategy, and rudimentary magical theory.

The "Mark of the Sky" from the prophecy manifested as an unusual birthmark on Rulthaar's shoulder—a pattern resembling a comet that matched the celestial event visible at his birth. Though his parents attempted to keep this mark hidden, rumors of its existence followed the family.

### Military Training and Early Career

By age fifteen, Rulthaar was actively participating in his father's mercenary operations:

- He served first as a standard-bearer, then as a scout, and eventually as a junior officer
- He demonstrated unusual tactical insight, suggesting successful strategies during campaigns in Serenissima and the Archipelagos
- He survived several wounds that would have killed others, earning the nickname "the Lucky" among his father's troops
- He studied the fighting styles of each region where they served, developing a hybrid combat approach that incorporated diverse techniques

At age twenty, tragedy struck when the Granite Shields were betrayed by their employer, the Duke of Westmere in Aethelgard. In a night attack, most of the company including Rulthaar's father was slaughtered. Rulthaar led the survivors—barely thirty fighters—in a daring escape through enemy lines.

### The Wilderness Years

Following the destruction of his father's company, Rulthaar disappeared from historical records for approximately five years (-255 to -250 OR). Various accounts suggest he:

- Traveled to Kharadum to study metallurgy and weapons-crafting
- Spent time among the druids of Sylvandell learning natural magic
- Visited the Shifting Sands and encountered the aging seer Kahlima
- Underwent a spiritual transformation in the volcanic wastes of Pyros

While the details remain disputed, what is clear is that when Rulthaar reemerged, he was transformed. No longer the young officer known as "the Lucky," he now called himself "the Invincible" and spoke openly of unifying Crayteria under a single rule—his own.

## The Foundation of Power

### The Gathering of the Faithful

Rulthaar's return to public life began not with military conquest but with a gathering of followers. In the neutral trading city of Crossroads (in central Aethelgard), he established what he called the "Circle of Unity"—a philosophical and political movement dedicated to ending the perpetual conflicts plaguing Crayteria.

The Circle attracted diverse adherents:
- Merchants tired of disrupted trade routes
- Veterans disillusioned by endless wars
- Scholars interested in preserving knowledge across political boundaries
- Common people suffering under the weight of conflict and instability

Rulthaar's message combined practical concerns with mystical elements, explicitly connecting himself to the Prophecy of the Unifier while offering concrete solutions to immediate problems. His personal charisma and strategic mind allowed him to build a substantial following without initially alarming established powers, who viewed him as merely another eccentric cult leader.

### The Forging of the Banner

A pivotal moment in Rulthaar's rise was the creation of his legendary Banner of Unity, explicitly fulfilling that element of the prophecy. In a public ceremony in -248 OR, he:

- Gathered soil from all fourteen continents, collected by his followers
- Combined metals from Kharadum, fabrics from Serenissima, dyes from Xylos, and other materials from across Crayteria
- Incorporated magical elements representing different traditions
- Performed a ritual during a rare celestial alignment, infusing the banner with symbolic and possibly actual power

The completed Banner of Unity displayed a stylized map of Crayteria with all continents connected by golden threads, surrounded by fourteen stars. When unfurled in battle, it was said to inspire unnatural courage in Rulthaar's followers and doubt in his enemies. Whether through magic or psychological impact, the banner became a powerful symbol of his cause.

### The First Victory

Rulthaar's transformation from philosophical leader to military conqueror began with a defensive action that demonstrated his tactical genius. In -247 OR, the city of Crossroads came under attack from the forces of Duke Malavon of Westmere—the same nobleman who had betrayed Rulthaar's father's mercenary company years earlier.

Despite being outnumbered three to one, Rulthaar organized the city's defense:
- He trained civilians in basic military formations
- He used his knowledge of Aethelgardian military tactics to anticipate enemy movements
- He employed unconventional strategies that confused the attacking forces
- He personally led a decisive counterattack that broke the siege

The victory was complete—Duke Malavon was captured, his army scattered, and his territories left vulnerable. Rather than merely defending Crossroads, Rulthaar seized the opportunity to launch his first campaign of conquest, moving swiftly to occupy Westmere and incorporate its resources into his growing power base.

The manner of his victory seemed to confirm another aspect of the prophecy—his apparent invincibility in battle. Though wounded twice during the fighting, neither injury slowed him, and witnesses claimed that several arrows and sword strikes seemed to be deflected by an invisible force.

### From Defensive Leader to Conqueror

The conquest of Westmere marked a crucial transition in how Rulthaar was perceived:

- To his followers, it confirmed his divine mandate and tactical brilliance
- To potential allies, it demonstrated his effectiveness as a military leader
- To established powers, it transformed him from curiosity to threat
- To the general population, it suggested he might actually fulfill the prophecy

Rulthaar himself changed his approach following this victory. He formally declared his intention to unify Crayteria, citing the endless cycle of wars as justification for a single rule. He established a governing structure for his conquered territory that incorporated local leaders under his authority, demonstrating that his rule could bring stability rather than just more conflict.

Most significantly, he began actively recruiting a true army rather than relying on volunteers and militia. Using the resources of Westmere and Crossroads, he created the first units of what would become known as the Unity Legion—a professional force trained in his hybrid fighting style and fanatically loyal to his vision.

## The Prophecy Fulfilled

### The Twelve Campaigns Begin

With his power base established and the Unity Legion growing, Rulthaar launched the first of what would indeed become twelve major military campaigns, exactly as the prophecy had foretold. In -246 OR, he marched against the remaining duchies of Western Aethelgard, beginning the systematic fulfillment of his prophesied destiny.

Each victory brought more resources and recruits to his cause. Each conquest was followed by pragmatic governance that often improved conditions for common people while incorporating useful elements of local leadership into his growing administration. And with each success, the prophecy gained credibility, creating a self-reinforcing cycle where belief in his inevitable victory often led to reduced resistance.

### The Man Behind the Myth

As Rulthaar's power grew, so too did the legends surrounding him. Contemporary accounts describe him as:

- Tall and powerfully built, with piercing eyes that seemed to "see through deception"
- Capable of speaking multiple languages fluently, allowing him to address conquered peoples in their native tongues
- Possessing an eidetic memory that allowed him to recall the names and deeds of even minor followers
- Demonstrating both ruthless determination in battle and surprising mercy in victory
- Maintaining a simple personal lifestyle despite growing wealth and power

Historical records suggest a more complex reality behind the mythic figure. Rulthaar was undoubtedly charismatic and militarily gifted, but he was also:

- Calculating in his use of the prophecy to legitimize his conquests
- Willing to use both diplomacy and deception when direct force proved impractical
- Capable of brutal reprisals against those who repeatedly opposed him
- Pragmatic in adopting useful administrative practices from conquered territories
- Increasingly isolated as his power grew, relying on a small circle of trusted advisors

This combination of genuine ability, strategic myth-making, and practical governance made him far more effective than previous would-be unifiers, allowing him to sustain momentum through the twelve campaigns that would ultimately create the first united Crayteria.

### The Role of the Prophecy in Rulthaar's Success

The prophecy played a crucial role in Rulthaar's rise, but not merely as supernatural validation. He actively used it as:

- A psychological weapon that undermined enemy morale
- A recruitment tool that attracted those seeking to be on the "right side of history"
- A governing framework that gave cosmic significance to administrative decisions
- A diplomatic instrument that encouraged peaceful submission to the "inevitable"

Whether Rulthaar truly believed he was fulfilling a divine mandate remains debated by historians. What is clear is that he understood the power of the prophecy as a narrative and skillfully incorporated it into his military and political strategy, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy through his own actions.

As his conquests continued and his legend grew, the question increasingly became not whether Rulthaar would unify Crayteria, but which would be the "twins of isolation" that would remain beyond his reach—the final element of the prophecy yet to be fulfilled as his campaigns swept across the continents.
