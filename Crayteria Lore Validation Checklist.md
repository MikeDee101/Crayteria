# Crayteria Lore Validation Checklist

This checklist will be used to ensure consistency and depth across all aspects of the Crayteria worldbuilding project.

## I. Continental Consistency (For each of the 14 continents):

- [ ] **Geographical Consistency:** Does the continent's described geography align with its placement on the global map (if one exists or is implied) and with the global climate patterns described in `crayteria_geography_ecology_magic.md`? Are its unique geographical features plausible within the established planetary characteristics?
- [ ] **Historical Timeline:** Is the continent's historical timeline internally consistent? Do major eras and events flow logically? Are there any unexplained gaps or contradictions?
- [ ] **Cultural Cohesion:** Do the described cultures, peoples, arts, and traditions logically arise from the continent's geography, history, and resource availability? Are they distinct yet believable?
- [ ] **Echoes/Magic System Integration:** Does the local manifestation of The Echoes align with the global magic system rules outlined in `crayteria_geography_ecology_magic.md`? Are the described magical abilities and limitations consistent with the continent's culture and environment? Are there any contradictions with how Echoes work elsewhere?
- [ ] **Religious Beliefs:** Do the religious systems make sense in the context of the continent's history, culture, and its inhabitants' relationship with The Echoes and the natural world? Are they internally consistent?
- [ ] **Flora and Fauna:** Does the described flora and fauna fit the continent's biome and climate as described in `crayteria_geography_ecology_magic.md`? Are unique creatures/plants plausible within the established ecological rules?
- [ ] **Interactions with Other Continents:** If the continent is described as interacting with others, are these interactions consistent with the political, social, and geographical realities of all involved parties as detailed in `crayteria_political_social_systems.md` and individual continent files?

## II. Global Systems Consistency:

- [ ] **Planetary Characteristics:** Is information about Crayteria's size, axial tilt, day/night cycle, year length, moons, and star consistent across all documents that mention them (primarily `crayteria_geography_ecology_magic.md`)?
- [ ] **Oceans and Climate:** Are the descriptions of major oceans, seas, currents, and global climate patterns consistent and do they logically impact the individual continents as described?
- [ ] **Ecology (Global):** Are the major biomes, signature flora/fauna, and ecological interdependencies described in `crayteria_geography_ecology_magic.md` reflected accurately or plausibly in the individual continent descriptions?
- [ ] **The Echoes (Magic System - Global):** Are the fundamental nature, origin theories, manifestations, and universal principles of The Echoes consistently applied or referenced across all continents? Do local variations make sense within the global framework?
- [ ] **Political and Social Systems (Global):** Does the overview in `crayteria_political_social_systems.md` accurately reflect and synthesize the diverse systems detailed in individual continent files? Are major power blocs, forms of governance, social hierarchies, and economic systems plausible and consistent with the established lore?
- [ ] **Intercontinental Relations:** Are the described trade routes, conflicts, alliances, and cultural exchanges between continents logical and consistent with their individual characteristics and the global political landscape?

## III. Narrative and Thematic Cohesion:

- [ ] **Depth and Detail:** Does the world feel rich, deep, and detailed, in line with the project's goal of emulating George R. R. Martin's style? Are there enough unique elements to make Crayteria memorable?
- [ ] **Plausibility (Internal Logic):** While fantastical, does the world operate under a consistent internal logic? Are there any elements that stretch believability too far, even for a fantasy setting?
- [ ] **Conflict and Story Potential:** Does the established lore provide ample opportunities for conflict, intrigue, and storytelling? Are there inherent tensions and unresolved questions that could drive narratives?
- [ ] **Naming Conventions:** Are naming conventions for places, people, and concepts relatively consistent within cultures, yet distinct between them?
- [ ] **Avoidance of Contradictions:** Have all files been cross-referenced to ensure no direct contradictions exist in dates, names, events, or descriptions of abilities/places?
- [ ] **Completeness (as per plan):** Have all planned aspects of worldbuilding been addressed to a satisfactory level of detail?

## IV. Specific Checks based on Previous Files:

- [ ] **Aethelgard Major & Minor:** Relationship, Sundering impact, cultural divergence consistent?
- [ ] **Xylos:** Wildness vs. potential for exploitation, tribal diversity consistent?
- [ ] **Solara & Shifting Sands:** Differentiate desert cultures and oasis mechanics clearly?
- [ ] **Cryonia & Pyros:** Extreme environment adaptations consistent and believable?
- [ ] **Archipelagos of Whispers & Serenissima:** Water-based cultures, trade, and magic distinct yet plausible?
- [ ] **Valdoria & Kharadum:** Mountain/plateau cultures, resource focus, isolation vs. conflict consistent?
- [ ] **Sylvandell:** Nature-based magic and isolationism consistently portrayed?
- [ ] **Sky-Reaches:** High/Lowland dynamics, aerial aspects consistent?
- [ ] **Umbralia:** Mystery maintained, speculative elements internally consistent and distinct from other
