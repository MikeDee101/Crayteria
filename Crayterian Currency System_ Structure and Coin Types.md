# Crayterian Currency System: Structure and Coin Types

## Currency Hierarchy

The Crayterian monetary system consists of a hierarchical structure of coins in three primary metals:

1. **Gold Tier**
   - Cidoki (highest value)
   - Ab

2. **Silver Tier**
   - Cotedo
   - Macep

3. **Bronze Tier**
   - Deikous (lowest value)

## Exchange Rates

The official exchange rates between these currencies are:

- 1 gold cidoki = 15 gold ab
- 1 gold ab = 18 silver cotedo
- 3 silver cotedo = 16 silver macep
- 3 silver macep = 27 bronze deikous

## Derived Exchange Values

Based on these rates, we can calculate the following relationships:

- 1 gold cidoki = 15 gold ab
- 1 gold cidoki = 270 silver cotedo (15 × 18)
- 1 gold cidoki = 1,440 silver macep (270 × 16 ÷ 3)
- 1 gold cidoki = 12,960 bronze deikous (1,440 × 27 ÷ 3)

- 1 gold ab = 18 silver cotedo
- 1 gold ab = 96 silver macep (18 × 16 ÷ 3)
- 1 gold ab = 864 bronze deikous (96 × 27 ÷ 3)

- 1 silver cotedo = 5.33... silver macep (16 ÷ 3)
- 1 silver cotedo = 48 bronze deikous (5.33... × 27 ÷ 3)

- 1 silver macep = 9 bronze deikous (27 ÷ 3)

## Regional Distribution

The currency system reflects the complex political landscape of Crayteria, with different coins originating from and primarily used in specific regions:

1. **Gold Cidoki** - Primarily minted in Kharadum and Aethelgard, used for major international trade
2. **Gold Ab** - Common in Serenissima and Solara, used for significant commercial transactions
3. **Silver Cotedo** - Widespread in Valdoria and Xylos, used for moderate trade and professional services
4. **Silver Macep** - Common in Pyros and the Archipelagos of Whispers, used for everyday transactions
5. **Bronze Deikous** - Universal throughout Crayteria, used for small purchases and by common people

## Historical Context

The current system evolved from the unification efforts of the Oracle, who standardized previously disparate regional currencies to facilitate trade across Crayteria. Before standardization, each continent had its own monetary system, remnants of which can still be seen in the names and designs of the current coins.

## Practical Usage

In practice, most everyday transactions use silver macep and bronze deikous, while gold coins are primarily used by nobles, merchants, and for international trade. The fractional relationships between coins create a system that allows for precise valuation while maintaining practical usability.
