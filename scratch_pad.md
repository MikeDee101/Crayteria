## Hospitality

In Crayteria, hospitality is a sacred duty, often intertwined with concepts of honor and reciprocity. Refusing hospitality to a traveler, especially in harsh environments like Solara or Cryonia, is considered a grave offense. However, the nature and extent of hospitality can vary:

*   **Aethelgard & Valdoria:** Formalized guest rights are common. Offering bread and salt (or local equivalents) signifies a pact of protection. Hosts are expected to provide the best they have, and guests are expected to be respectful and not overstay their welcome without contributing.
*   **Kharadum:** Pragmatism rules. Hospitality is offered, but there's an underlying expectation of mutual benefit or future obligation. Information or skills can be as valuable as material goods in trade.
*   **Solara & Cryonia:** Survival dictates the terms. Offering shelter and sustenance is crucial, but resources are scarce. Guests are expected to contribute to the household's needs quickly.
*   **Xylos & Sylvandell:** Hospitality is deeply connected to the natural world. Offering shelter might involve guiding someone to a safe cave or sharing knowledge of edible plants. Respect for the environment is paramount.
*   **Serenissima:** Hospitality is an art form, involving elaborate rituals and displays of generosity. However, it can also be a subtle way of gathering information or asserting dominance.

## Pastimes

Leisure activities in Crayteria are diverse and reflect the cultural values and environments of its people.

*   **Storytelling and Oral Traditions:** Across many cultures, especially those without widespread literacy (like some parts of Solara or Cryonia), storytelling, song, and poetry are vital forms of entertainment and cultural transmission.
*   **Games of Strategy and Chance:** Board games, dice games, and card games (where they exist) are popular in taverns, homes, and marketplaces.
*   **Music and Dance:** Every culture has its unique forms of music and dance, often tied to celebrations, rituals, or simply everyday life.
*   **Physical Contests:** Feats of strength, speed, and skill, such as wrestling, racing, and archery, are common, particularly in martial cultures like Valdoria or among the hunters of Cryonia.
*   **Craftsmanship and Artistry:** In cultures like Sylvandell or Serenissima, creating beautiful or intricate objects can be a form of leisure and self-expression.
*   **Exploration and Discovery:** In vast and mysterious lands like Xylos or the uncharted territories beyond the known world, exploration itself can be a pastime for the adventurous.
